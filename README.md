# Django Library

For detailed information about this project see the associated [MDN tutorial home page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Django/Tutorial_local_library_website).

## Overview

This web application creates an online catalog for a small local library, where users can browse available books and manage their accounts.

The main features that have currently been implemented are:

* There are models for books, book copies, genre, language and authors.
* Users can view list and detail information for books and authors.
* Admin users can create and manage models. The admin has been optimised (the basic registration is present in admin.py, but commented out).
* Librarians can renew reserved books

## Quick Start

To get this project up and running locally on your computer:
1. Set up the [Python development environment](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Django/development_environment).
   We recommend using a Python virtual environment.
   > **Note:** This has been tested against Django 3.1.2 (and may not work or be "optimal" for other versions).
1. Assuming you have Python setup, run the following commands (if you're on Windows you may use `py` or `py -3` instead of `python` to start Python):
   ```
   pip3 install -r requirements.txt
   python3 manage.py makemigrations
   python3 manage.py migrate
   python3 manage.py collectstatic
   python3 manage.py createsuperuser # Create a superuser
   python3 manage.py runserver
   ```
1. Open a browser to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/` to open the admin site
1. Create a few test objects of each type.
1. Open tab to `http://127.0.0.1:8000` to see the main site, with your new objects.

## Start with Docker
Before installation, make sure that your host machine supports virtualization, and that it is enabled.
For Windows: Make sure that you have Hyper-V enabled.

Then download and install Docker, Docker-Compose

Launch

Tilt the repository to yourself!
To run the program, use:
   ```
docker compose up --build
   ```

The application is available at http://127.0.0.1:8000/
